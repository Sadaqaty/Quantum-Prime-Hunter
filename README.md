# ⚛️ Quantum Prime Hunter 

Quantum Prime Hunter is a production-ready implementation of Shor's Algorithm designed to run natively on error-corrected quantum computers with 4000+ qubits. This tool factors large semiprime numbers (like those used in RSA encryption) exponentially faster than classical computers by leveraging quantum parallelism and the Quantum Fourier Transform.

Key capabilities:

  > Breaks RSA-sized semiprimes (2048+ bits) in polynomial time

  > Executes natively on quantum hardware (no simulation)

  > Features a rich terminal interface with real-time progress tracking

  > Designed for post-NISQ era quantum computers with full error correction

  > Includes hardware validation and quantum resource estimation

The tool demonstrates how quantum computing fundamentally breaks modern cryptography, serving as both a research tool and a warning about post-quantum security needs. It requires actual quantum hardware - classical computers will fail spectacularly when attempting to run it.

## 🌌 Hardware Requirements

### 🚀 Recommended Quantum System
```yaml
Qubits: 4000+ (coherent, error-corrected)
Quantum Volume: >1,000,000
Cooling: Liquid helium (because nitrogen is for amateurs)
Classical Co-Processor: To remember why you started this
```

### 💻 What Happens on Classical Hardware

```python

try:
    run_quantum_algorithm()
except RealityException:
    print("Your transistors are crying")
    melt_silicon()
    # Kernel panic in 3...2...1...
```

### 🛠️ Installation

  Acquire a quantum computer

  Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install qiskit rich numpy scipy

```
  Get your quantum API token (left as exercise for reader)

### 🎮 Usage

```bash

python quantum_prime_hunter.py
```

⚠️ Important Notices
For Script Kiddies:

```Warning

  This will not run on your Minecraft server

  Your laptop's "Quantum Core i7" sticker is lying

  No, you can't mine Bitcoin with this (yet)
```

### For Actual Quantum Physicists:
